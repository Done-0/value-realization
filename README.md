## What It Does

Analyzes product ideas through four dimensions:

| Dimension | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Value Clarity** | Can end users articulate what they'll achieve? |
| **Value Timeline** | When do end users see results? |
| **Value Perception** | Can end users see/feel their progress? |
| **Value Discovery** | How do end users come to understand the value? |

## When to Use

Triggers when you:

- Discuss product ideas with uncertainty
- Evaluate features or plan marketing strategies
- Analyze user adoption or retention problems
- Ask "is this idea good?", "will users want this?", "why aren't users staying?"

## Real Case Studies

Includes quantitative analysis of real products:

**✅ Success**
- **Dropbox**: 3900% growth in 15 months — clear value proposition
- **Instagram**: Identity transformation from photo sharing to photographer status
- **Duolingo**: 500M+ users — long-term value with optional short-term touchpoints
- **WeChat**: 1.3B users — "use and go" philosophy building trust

**❌ Failure**
- **Google Wave**: Shut down 14 months after launch — abstract value proposition
- **Quibi**: $1.75B funding, shut down in 6 months — unclear differentiation

All cases include data sources and quantitative metrics.

## Philosophy

End users adopt products when they **know** what value they'll achieve.

**Core insight:**
- If end users know they'll achieve something valuable (even long-term), they'll use it
- If end users don't know what they'll achieve, they won't use it — no matter how good the product is

**Value types:** Identity, financial gain, short/long-term benefits, status, capability, time savings, problem resolution.
